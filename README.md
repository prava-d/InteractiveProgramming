# InteractiveProgramming

This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

Here is what you will need to install:

Twitter-mining:
```
$ sudo pip3 install python-twitter
```
Pygame:
```
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev
$ sudo pip3 install pygame
```
Word-processing:
```
$ sudo pip install -U nltk
```

First, download all the image files.

Then, download either the pickle files or the twitter_textmining.py file (and run the subsequent file for the pickle).

Download phrase_extractor.py and main.py.

Run main.py. Hover over the candidate's names in order to see lines drawn, depicting the sentiment of candidates' tweets towards other candidates.
